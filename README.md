Passionate about building scalable, user-centric solutions, Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer with expertise in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), Python, Java, and DevOps tools like Docker and AWS. My portfolio showcases a diverse range of projectsâ€”from e-commerce platforms and machine learning models to automated web scrapersâ€”each designed to solve real-world problems with clean, efficient code. With a strong foundation in both frontend aesthetics and backend logic, I thrive in dynamic environments where innovation meets execution. My open-source contributions and hackathon wins reflect my commitment to continuous learning and community collaboration.
